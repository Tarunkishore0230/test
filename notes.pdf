we can also use {display: inline-block} 
{display:none;} is used for removing element as they didnot exist*/

2)relative- it doesnt effect other elements, only object slected are effected by this postoning. e.g., img{
    position:relative
    right:30px;
}  it meassure to shift in any direction from its own cordinate as ex. it detemines to shift to left of screen by 30px from its present space
3)absolute- e.g., img {
    position:absolute
    right:30px;
} it follows the screen path to get the shift to either of the four sides as in example it specifies space from ri8 side of screen
